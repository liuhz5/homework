## 1、Program with machine language according to the following c.
int_8 a = 1;
int_8 c = a + 3;

1）Write your assembly code & machine code

- assembly code：LOD # 1–>STO X –> LOD X –> ADD#3 –> STO Y –> HLT
00
- machine code：00000000 00000001 –> 0001zzzz 00000011

2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle：

- Main memory –> fetch instruction –> Decode instruction –>Registers –>Get data –>Execute the instruction

3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU

- IR：指令寄存器，保存当前正在执行的指令。  
- PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址。
- ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果。

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine


## 2、简答题

1）What are stored in memory?


指令和数据


2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

可以

3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.

00000000 10000001

第4位二进制数代表寻址模式：1表示操作数是数值，0表示操作数是该地址的内容；第5~8位二进制数代表操作码；后八位代表一个数值，或者一个内存地址。
例子中表示内存中地址129的数据


## 3、解释以下词汇

1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）:

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

2）编译（Compiler):

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）:

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）:

 &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）:

 &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
