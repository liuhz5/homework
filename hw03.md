## 1)Method of complements
In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

## 2)Byte
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

## 3)Integer (computer science)
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

## 4)Floating point
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen.

## 1)请证明：二进制的负数（two‘s complement of X）等于 X 的 ones’ complement ＋ 1（即，X每位求反加1）

证明：假设一个正整数a，由 K0 K1 ... K(n-1) 共n位二进制组成，n位二进制，最高位为符号位，模为2^(n-1），，a是正数即可以看做绝对值。所以等式左边的含义就是求一个数的补码。根据二进制转十进制数的方法，我们可以把a表示为：a=k0*2^0+k1*2^1+k2*2^2+……+k(n-2)*2^(n-2），第（n-1）位为符号位不计算在内。 2^(n-1)=1+2^0+2^1+2^2+……+2^(n-2），这里k0,k1,k2,k(n-2)是1或者0，所以右边2^(n-1)-a=(1-k(n-2))*2^(n-2)+(1-k(n-3))*2^(n-3)+……+(1-k2)*2^2+(1-k1)*2^1+(1-k0)*2^0+1，而这步转化正是取反再加1的规则的代数原理所在。因为这里k0,k1,k2,k3……不是0就是1，所以1－k0,1-k1,1-k2的运算就是二进制下的取反，而为什么要加1，追溯起来就是2^(n-1）的二项展开式最后还有一项1的缘故。

## 1) NaN 是什么？
In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.
